# How to contribute

Thank you for contributing to this repositories, I am really delighted that you choose to help!
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me!

This repository used a ["fork & pull"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model. This means that you should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) (that means personal copy) my repository to your GitHub account. If you are using windows, the GitHub for Windows software is a good start. You can also use directly the git softwareFrom there, you can work as you want, committing what you want. Afterwards, the goal is to pull some of the modification back to the master repositories, in order to let the other user benefit from your inputs.

For more details, you can consults those articles:
 * [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)
 * [General work-flow of git](http://git-scm.com/about)
 * [Git original software](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
 * [Software with a user interface for git](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
 * [GitHub for windows, what I am using](https://windows.github.com/)

## Testing

Depending of what you want to contribute, please make sure that a fully functional script example, ideally one which produce clear graph/data, can shows that your change are working.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should be explained.

## Coding conventions

Start reading my code and you'll get the hang of it. I try to optimize for readability:

  * I indent using tabs
  * I try to name variable with minuscule and function with capital. example: variable frequencyDrive1. function: RebuildField()
  * Make plots :) Even if you comment them out afterwards, it help to understand what is done.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Thanks,

Gael
