# BasicsMPI #

The basic functions to:
+ simulate the creation of MPI-signal using a Langevin model for the magnetization of the particle,
+ simulate the encoding princples of the MPI-signal
+ simulate a 2D FFP scanner which is made of ideal/pure fields and obtain the system matrix basis functions
+ simulate a 2D FFL scanner which is made of ideal/pure field and obtain the systemmatrix basis functions

More details on the workflow for the similation of MPI-signal for scanners is given in the [wiki](https://github.com/gBringout/BasicsMPI/wiki)

## MPI-signal creation ##
We create these graph and the associated data about the signal generation, 'in' the FFP, with the script "SignalGeneration.m"

## MPI-signal encoding ##
We create these graph and the associated data about the signal encoding, when a field offset is present, with the script "SignalEncoding.m"
